# Deep Learning Tutorials: Python, Numpy and Keras
I built these python codes (on Jupyter Notebook) to help beginners grasp concrete understanding on neural networks and deep learning. These tutorial codes begins from the simplest neural network - the perceptron - to multi-layer, convolutional, and recurrent deep neural networks. The earlier parts of tutorials use only numpy as numerical calculation package. This way, a learner can build a neural network and backpropagation more explicitly than using deep learning packages such as Tensorflow or Keras. Later on, we switch to use Keras to build and train deep neural networks. 

I tried to make codes as self-explanatory, but more descriptions and explanations will be added later.
